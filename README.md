SuperTicTacToe
===============

Super tic-tac-toe can be played in three different modes: local 2 player, play against the computer, and play online. Each is described below.

### Local 2 Player:

This is a regular game of super tic-tac-toe, where both players play from the same computer. Turns switch off depending on the player.

### Play the Computer:

To play the computer, first select the computer's difficulty level (easy/medium/hard).

### Play Online: 

##### Online play has been disabled due to server fees

This option is available for players who want to play from two separate computers. This version of the game is played over a network, and each player can connect to the game from their own computer. The play then proceeds back and forth, with each player choosing a square for X/O on their turn. The networked version can support up to 3 games played at once.
